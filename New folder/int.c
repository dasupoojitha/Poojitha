/*c program to print the sentence using double quotes in string format.
Strings are used for storing text/characters. For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters. Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables.
A syntax string is a group of characters and syntax codes ( # , * , & , @ , ~ , ? , ( , ) , % , and ^ ) enclosed in single quotation marks ( ' ). Syntax strings can be used to specifying a field syntax, such as postal code or telephone number. They are also useful when searching for and comparing or replacing strings.
