/*write a program using arrays with integers.
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
To access an array element, refer to its index number.
Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.
